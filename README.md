# Fastest Route Project

**Project Overview:**

The Fastest Route Project aims to provide a solution for finding the fastest route between cities in a network. By leveraging a visualization interface and Dijkstra's algorithm, the project simplifies travel planning and decision-making.

**Algorithm Breakdown:**

The project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path within the network:

1. **Graph Creation**: The network is represented as an adjacency list, enabling efficient graph traversal and manipulation.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest distance from a specified source node to all other nodes in the network.

3. **Optimal Route Determination**: The algorithm identifies the most efficient route by considering both bus and plane travel options, optimizing travel time while accommodating user preferences(i.e. max. one flight).

4. **Result Visualization**: The project visualizes the calculated shortest path on the network graph, providing users with a clear representation of the optimal route.
